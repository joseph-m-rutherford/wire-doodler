    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Wire antennas are a cost-effective and accessible means to transduce electrical signals into radiating fields for radio operators, especially amateur radio operators building equipment from readily available equipment.\n",
    "Accurate simulations aid in the design process before building virtually any system, including wire antennas.\n",
    "The Numerical Electromagnetics Code (NEC) has long served the electromagnetic (EM) modeling community with solutions to wire antenna problems, among other features [BurkeMillerPoggio2004].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling the salient physics of cylindrical conductors is a particular challenge for the EM modeling community [Ludwig1995] [PetersonBibby2004].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Compose a testbed for experimental methods of solving wire antenna problems.\n",
    "Supported geometry is restricted to 2D finite cross-sections extruded along 3D curves with transformations.\n",
    "Base case supported is cylinders (circles extruded along straight line segments) with hemispherical end caps.\n",
    "Frequency-domain antenna radiation via surface integral equation (SIE) formulations will be discretized for numerical solution using the Method of Moments (MoM).\n"

    "## Geometry\n",
    "\n",
    "All wires have a cylinder shape with a constant radius about the segment between the endpoints.\n",
    "The intersection of two non-colinear cylinders has an open wedge on the \"outside\" of the joint and a wedge on the \"inside\" of the joint.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Segment intersections require an intersecting sphere of radius greater than or equal to that of the largest wire at the joint.\n",
    "- If the largest end-point sphere radius exceeds that either wire, the inner wedge will be replaced by two less-sharp inner wedges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every wire is an independent body-of-revolution (BOR) suitable to evaluation using a local [cylindrical coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylindrical_coordinate_system).\n",
    "Every function defined on a BOR must have its axial mode specified using integer $m$ such that the function is scaled with $e^{i m \\phi}$.\n",
    "This detail will become important in composing the operator and right-hand-side (RHS) fill.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Governing Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "Composing a set of linear equations suitable for numerical solution is a non-trivial matter.\n",
    "To support low frequency analyses, we use a decoupled potentials method [Chew2014a].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Partial Differential Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "Following [Chew2014a, Eqs. (11)-(13)] we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{A} = -\\mu \\epsilon \\partial_t \\Phi$ (Lorenz gauge),\n",
    "- $\\nabla^2 \\Phi - \\mu \\epsilon \\partial_t^2 \\Phi = -\\rho/\\epsilon$ (scalar potential wave equation), and \n",
    "- $\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{A} - \\mu \\epsilon \\partial_t^2 \\mathbf{A} = -\\mu \\mathbf{J}$ (vector potential wave equation).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Surface Integral Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "Following [Chew2014a, Eqs. (60) and (61)] for perfect electrical conductor (PEC):\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\overline{\\mathbf{\\Gamma}}_{J,J} \\cdot \\mathbf{j} + \\overline{\\mathbf{\\Gamma}}_{J,\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{s} = -\\mathbf{a}_\\mathrm{inc}$,\n",
    "- $\\overline{\\mathbf{\\Gamma}}_{\\sigma,J} \\cdot \\mathbf{j} + \\overline{\\mathbf{\\Gamma}}_{\\sigma,\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{s} - \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} \\cdot \\mathbf{s} = -\\mathbf{\\sigma}_\\mathrm{inc}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors and operators are defined in keeping with [Chew2014a, Eqs. (62) - (69)].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Local Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Physical quantities being expanded in basis functions are surface currents $\\mathbf{J}$ and $\\Sigma = \\hat{\\mathbf{n}} \\cdot \\mathbf{A}$ which functions in a role similar to that of a surface charge.\n",
    "The testing functions are in the space of the tangent vector potential $\\hat{t} \\cdot \\mathbf{A}$ and $\\Sigma$, respectively.\n",
    "This informs the choice of divergence-conforming tangential functions for the surface currents source- and tangential vector potential test-functions; the basis and test functions for the \"surface charge\" quantities are gradient-conforming surface functions.\n",
    "Every cylinder is traversed in two orthogonal local directions: axially in the local $z$-direction or azimuthally in the local $\\phi$-direction.\n",
    "Cylinder-joint and -end associated caps use zenithal sampling in the local $\\theta$-direction and azimuthally in the local $\\phi$-direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Azimuthal variations in all functions are captured using a scaling of $e^{i m \\phi}, m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n",
    "- Axial variations in the function on a cylinder is characterized by linear interpolation between shared vertices for the flow of current.\n",
    "- Terminal cylinder ends are truncated at one radius-length from the end and capped with hemispheres.\n",
    "- Joints between non-parallel wires are filled with partial-sphere-wedge caps with constant zenithal current flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives rise to the following source-observation surface function pairings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- cylinder-cylinder distant\n",
    "- cap-cap distant\n",
    "- cap-cylinder distant\n",
    "- cylinder-cylinder shared-edge\n",
    "- cap-cylinder shared-edge\n",
    "- cylinder-cylinder self-interaction\n",
    "- cap-cap self-interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector (tangent) functions require consideration for both axial/zenithal and azimuthal vector directions.\n",
    "Scalar functions as well as interactions between scalar and vector functions must be considered for each of these."
