Electromagnetic model ideas sketched with wires

Numerical Electromagnetics Code (NEC) has a long history as a valued wire-geometry-based antenna modeling tool.
Wire-geometry-based methods assume a rotationally-invariant finte element, which provides a mechanism to simplify the physics model.
This project provides a framework for low-level experimentation with electromagnetic modeling concepts based on simple wire models.
